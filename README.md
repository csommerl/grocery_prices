## Strategy

Make list of inputs, iterate over list?

Write a program for logging and viewing prices for grocery items at different stores. The requirements are the following:
- The program must be written in Python.
- The program must store data in a JSON file. Create the file if it doesn't already exist.
- When starting the program, it should prompt the user to either (l)og or (v)iew.
- When logging, ask the user for the item name, grocery store name, item quantity in ounces, and item price.
- When viewing, ask the user for the item name. Then, display the price per ounce at each grocery store.
